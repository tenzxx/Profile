An Instagram influencer wishes to create a report for assessing their engagement with their followers.

To categorize the influencer's following, we will classify them as having a "Large Following" if they possess more than 1000 followers, or as having a "Moderate Following" if they have 1000 or fewer followers.

Note: To implement this, we will define a class called "Profile" that includes an attribute for the number of followers.
Input Format
The input consists of an integer representing the number of followers the influencer has.
Output Format
If the follower count is greater than 1000, the output prints "Influencer has large followers"
If the follower count is 1000 or fewer, the output prints "Influencer has moderate followers"
Constraints
0 <= Number of followers <= 106
